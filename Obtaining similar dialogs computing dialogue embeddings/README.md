# Obtaining similar dialogs using embeddings

Given two dialogs, this code is capable of computing their dialog embeddings and compare them in terms of cosine similarity. We used the Sentence-BERT (SBERT) approach proposedby Reimers and Gurevych (2019), which is a modification of the pre-trained BERT network that uses siamese  and triplet network structures to derive semantically meaningful sentence embeddings that can be compared using cosine-similarity.
